parse_power_log.py

This module provides a utility function to analyze GPU power logs and extract
energy usage statistics.

The expected input is a CSV file containing timestamped GPU metrics, including
power draw, utilization, and memory usage. The file is assumed to be logged at
1-second intervals.

Although the module is not part of the experiment pipeline itself, users can choose to 
integrate it to log power and memory metrics using nvidia-smi.

Function:
- parse_power_log: Parses the power log CSV and returns estimated energy
                   consumption (in joules) and average power draw (in watts).

def parse_power_log(filename="logs/gpu_power_log.csv"):
    """
    Parse a GPU power log CSV file and compute energy and average power.

    The log file is expected to contain the following columns:
    - timestamp (ignored)
    - power (e.g., "123.4 W")
    - utilization (e.g., "56 %")
    - memory (e.g., "2048 MiB")

    This function extracts numeric values from the log, drops corrupt entries,
    and computes:
        - Average power (in watts)
        - Total energy usage (in joules), assuming 1-second sampling

    Args:
        filename (str): Path to the power log CSV file.

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, float]: 
            - Total energy consumed (in joules)
            - Average power draw (in watts)

        If parsing fails, returns (None, None).
